## Overview

I found setup vuetify annoying in [this pertty good template](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue), so I pushed this on github (i know i shoud branch oneday).

#### Check out the detailed documentation of the original template [here](https://simulatedgreg.gitbooks.io/electron-vue/content/index.html).

Things you'll find in this boilerplate...

* Basic project structure with a **single** `package.json` setup
* Detailed [documentation](https://simulatedgreg.gitbooks.io/electron-vue/content/)
* Installed [vue-devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) and [devtron](https://github.com/electron/devtron) tools for development
* Ability to easily package your electron app using [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager) or [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder)\*
* `appveyor.yml` and `.travis.yml` configurations for automated deployments with [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder)\*
* Ability to produce web output for browsers
* Handy [NPM scripts](https://simulatedgreg.gitbooks.io/electron-vue/content/en/npm_scripts.html)
* Use of [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) and [vue-loader](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader) with Hot Module Replacement
* Process restarting when working in main process
* HTML/CSS/JS pre-processor support with [vue-loader](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/)
* ES6 with [`stage-0`](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-stage-0/) by default
* Use of [`babili`](https://github.com/babel/babili) to remove the need of transpiling completely down to ES5
* ESLint \(with support for [`standard`](https://github.com/feross/standard)
* Unit Testing \(with Karma + Mocha\)\*
* End-to-end Testing \(with Spectron + Mocha\)\*
